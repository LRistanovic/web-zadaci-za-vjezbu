                    You get a shiver in the dark,
                    It's raining in the park, but meantime:
                    South of the river, you stop and you hold everything.
                    A band is blowin' Dixie, double-four time.
                    You feel alright when you hear that music play.

                    You step inside, but you don't see too many faces.
                    Comin' in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down.
                    Competition in other places...
                    But the horns, they blowin' that sound.
                    Way on down south,
                    Way on down south, London-town

                    Check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords.
                    But it's strictly rhythm; he doesn't want to make it cry or sing.
                    If any old guitar is all he can afford,
                    When he gets up under the lights to play his thing.

                    And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene.
                    He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright.
                    He can play the honky tonk like anything,
                    Savin' it up for Friday night.
                    With the Sultans,
                    With the Sultans of Swing

                    And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner,
                    Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles.
                    The don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band.
                    It ain't what they call rock and roll.
                    And the Sultans,
                    Yes the Sultans play Creole.

                    And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone.
                    And says at last, just as the time bell rings, "
                    Goodnight, now it's time to go home."
                    And he makes it fast, with one more thing:"
                    We're the Sultans, "
                    We are the Sultans of Swing."

                    People are strange when you're a stranger
                    Faces look ugly when you're alone
                    Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
                    Streets are uneven when you're down
                    
                    When you're strange
                    Faces come out of the rain
                    When you're strange
                    No one remembers your name
                    When you're strange
                    When you're strange
                    When you're strange
                    
                    People are strange when you're a stranger
                    Faces look ugly when you're alone

                    When you're strange
                    Faces come out of the rain

                    I can't remember anything
                    Can't tell if this is true or dream
                    Deep down inside I feel to scream
                    This terrible silence stops me

                    Now that the war is through with me
                    I'm waking up, I cannot see
                    That there is not much left of me
                    Nothing is real but pain now

                    Hold my breath as I wish for death
                    Oh please, God, wake me

                    Back to the world that's much too real
                    In pumps life that I must feel
                    But can't look forward to reveal
                    Look to the time when I'll live

                    Fed through the tube that sticks in me
                    Just like a wartime novelty
                    Tied to machines that make me be
                    Cut this life off from me

                    Hold my breath as I wish for death
                    Oh please, God, wake me

                    Now the world is gone, I'm just one
                    Oh God, help me
                    Hold my breath as I wish for death
                    Oh please, God, help me

                    Darkness imprisoning me
                    All that I see
                    Absolute horror
                    I cannot live
                    I cannot die
                    Trapped in myself
                    Body my holding cell

                    Landmine has taken my sight
                    Taken my speech
                    Taken my hearing
                    Taken my arms
                    Taken my legs
                    Taken my soul
                    Left me with life in hell

                    Turn your head and see the fields of flames

                    He carries along
                    From a distant place
                    He's on his way
                    He'll bring decay
                    (Don't move along
                    'Cause things they will go wrong
                    The end is getting closer day by day)
                    In shades of grey
                    We're doomed to face the night
                    Light's out of sight

                    Since we've reached the point of no return
                    We pray for starlight we wait for the moon
                    The sky is empty
                    Alone in the unknown
                    We're getting nowhere

                    We have been betrayed
                    By the wind and rain
                    The sacred hall's empty and cold
                    The sacrifice made
                    Should not be done in vain
                    Revenge will be taken by Rome

                    We live a lie
                    Under the dying moon
                    Pale-faced laughs doom
                    Indulges in delight
                    It's getting out of hand
                    The final curtain will fall

                    Hear my voice
                    There is no choice
                    There's no way out
                    You'll find out

                    We don't regret it
                    So many men have failed
                    But now he's gone
                    Go out and get it
                    The madman's head it
                    Shall be thyne
                    We don't regret it
                    That someone else dies hidden in disguise
                    Go out and get it
                    Orion's hound shines bright

                    Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
                    Around the ring
                    Just stop running running
                    Round the ring
                    Don't you know that fate has been decided by the gods
                    Feel the distance, distance
                    Out of reach

                    Welcome to the end
                    Watch your step, Cassandra
                    You may fall
                    As I've stumbled on the field
                    Sister mine
                    Death's a certain thing
                    Find myself in darkest places
                    Find myself drifting away
                    And the other world
                    The other world appears

                    Find myself she dies in vain
                    I cannot be freed
                    I'm falling down
                    As time runs faster
                    Moves towards disaster
                    The ferryman will wait for you
                    My dear

                    And then there was silence
                    Just a voice from other world
                    Like a leaf in an icy world
                    Memories will fade

                    Misty tales and poems lost
                    All the bliss and beauty will be gone
                    Will my weary soul find release for a while
                    At the moment of death I will smile
                    It's the triumph of shame and disease
                    In the end Iliad

                    Raise my hands and praise the day
                    Break the spell show me the way
                    In decay
                    The flame of Troy will shine bright

                    The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
                    The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
                    Good choice?
                    Bad choice?
                    Out of there
                    You've chosen misery

                    Power and wisdom
                    You deny
                    Bad choice
                    War is the only answer
                    When love will conquer fear

                    So the judgement's been made to the fairest
                    The graceful says badly he fails
                    Warning

                    Fear the heat of passion, father king
                    Don't let him in
                    Don't let her in
                    Desire, lust, obsession
                    Death they'll bring
                    We can't get out
                    Once they are in

                    She's like the sunrise
                    Outshines the moon at night
                    Precious like starlight
                    She will bring in a murderous price

                    In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat
                    Jealousy
                    I can clearly see the end now
                    I can clearly see the end now
                    I can clearly see the end now

                    The thread of life is spun
                    The coin's been placed below my tongue
                    Never give up
                    Never give in
                    Be on our side
                    So we can win
                    Never give up
                    Never give in
                    Be on our side
                    Old moon's time is soon to come

                    Nowhere to run
                    Nowhere to hide
                    Nothing to lose
                    Like one we'll stand
                    We'll face the storm
                    Created by a man

                    Roar roar roar roar
                    Troy Troy Troy Troy

                    And as the lion
                    Slaughters man
                    I am the wolf
                    And you're the lamb

                    Hallowed Troy will fall
                    Round the walls
                    Faith is shattered bodies fall
                    Nowhere to run
                    Nowhere to hide
                    Nothing to lose
                    Like one we'll stand
                    It's all for one and one for all
                    We live for will be wiped out

                    I feel that something's wrong
                    Surprise, surprise they're gone
                    Full moon your time goes by
                    And new moon's still kept our of sight
                    We live we die

                    Misty tales and poems lost
                    All the bliss and beauty will be gone
                    Will my weary soul find release for a while
                    At the moment of death I will smile
                    It's the triumph of shame and disease
                    In the end Iliad

                    Raise my hands and praise the day
                    Break the spell show me the way
                    In decay
                    The flame of Troy will shine bright

                    Roam in darkness
                    Spread the vision
                    We will be lost if you truly believe
                    Troy in darkness
                    There's a cold emptiness in our hearts
                    That they've gone away
                    And won't come back

                    They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
                    They'll truly believe in the lie, lie, lie
                    With blossoms they'll welcome
                    The old foe

                    The vision's so clear
                    When day and dream unite
                    The end is near
                    You better be prepared

                    The nightmare shall be over now
                    There's nothing more to fear
                    Come join in our singing
                    And dance with us now
                    The nightmare shall be over now
                    There's nothing more to fear
                    The war it is over forevermore

                    No hope
                    The blind leads the blind
                    Carry on
                    Though future's denied
                    Mare or stallion
                    There's far more inside
                    We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die

                    Misty tales and poems lost
                    All the bliss and beauty will be gone
                    Will my weary soul find release for a while
                    At the moment of death I will smile
                    It's the triumph of shame and disease
                    In the end Iliad

                    Raise my hands and praise the day
                    Break the spell show me the way
                    In decay
                    The flame of Troy will shine bright

                    Holy light shines on
                    So the judgement's been made
                    We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
                    The crack of doom
                    Father
                    Your handsome son is heading home
                    Heading home

                    Still the wind blows
                    Calm and silent
                    Carries news from a distant shore
                    Out of mind
                    Can't get it
                    Can't get it
                    Out of me head
                    Sorrow and defeat
